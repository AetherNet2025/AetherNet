**Title**: AetherNet – Pre-Cyclogenesis Disruption Architecture  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Date**: 2025-09-13  
**Licenses**: Apache License 2.0 (code) + CC0 (docs & data)

## 1. Statement of Intent

This repository contains a **conceptual design** of the AetherNet architecture.  
It is released **solely for modeling, testing, and scientific evaluation**.  
It is **not** a field-ready deployment plan.  

The release exists to secure public ownership of the idea, prevent future enclosure or patenting, and invite rigorous global scrutiny.  

No provisional patent has been filed; instead, this public timestamp constitutes **permanent prior art**.  

---

## 2. Covered Elements

Explicitly open and unpatentable:  
- Drone swarm coordination logic (conceptual)  
- Pre-cyclogenesis atmospheric targeting strategies  
- Net-and-propeller turbulence disruption concepts  
- Real-time feedback learning models (illustrative)  
- Data sharing formats and open protocols  
- All diagrams, assumptions, and modeling updates  

Any embodiment that achieves pre-cyclogenesis airflow disruption is considered part of this open release.

## 3. Governance Principle

There is no central steward.  
All contributors must:  
- Retain Apache 2.0 + CC0 licensing  
- Avoid enclosure of derivatives  
- Disclose modifications transparently  

---

## 4. Post-Release Protections

- All data gathered or simulated under AetherNet must remain open.  
- All trained models, policies, and decision logic must remain redistributable.  
- The open status of this repository is permanent.

## 5. Irrevocability Clause

This release is **permanent and irrevocable**.  
No contributor, institution, or entity may reverse this open status or assert proprietary rights.

## 6. Disengagement Statement

The authors disengage after this release.  
Further evaluation, modeling, and governance discussion are fully in the hands of the global scientific community.
