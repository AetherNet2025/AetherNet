# AetherNet ‚Äì Open Concept Repository

AetherNet is a **research concept** in atmospheric intervention: an open hypothesis that disrupting airflow symmetries in the pre-cyclogenesis stage *might* reduce the likelihood of storm formation.  

This repository contains draft simulation modules, control logic sketches, and AI components released only for **scientific modeling and evaluation**.  
It is **not a deployment plan** ‚Äî the purpose is to invite universities, agencies, and international organizations to test, critique, and advance the idea.

## üîß Core Features (Conceptual)

- **Targeting logic sketches** for identifying unstable atmospheric patches using CAPE, vorticity, humidity, etc.  
- **Multi-role drone concepts** for mesh operators, scanners, relays, fallback units  
- **Hypothetical disruption strategies** such as vortex flaps, swirl, boundary sweeps, and corkscrew descent  
- **Peer-to-peer network protocols** with public-first data synchronization  
- **AI feedback loop framework** for testing success/failure in simulations
